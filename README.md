Scalacheck Cookbook
===================
This is a [ScalaCheck](http://www.scalacheck.org/) cookbook that produced a couple of years ago. It has been available for a while at Slideshare, here: http://www.slideshare.net/oscarrenalias/scalacheck-cookbook-v10. but it is now also available in Word, PDF and Markdown format.

The purpose of this document is to introduce Scala and Java developers to ScalaCheck, how to build test cases and how to integrate ScalaCheck cases with existing unit test case suites.

The document and examples are based on older [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) and [ScalaCheck](http://www.scalacheck.org/) versions, but will be updated shortly.

Source code for the examples can be found here: https://github.com/Accenture/scalacheck-examples.
